# Stakeholder Inputs

In this directory, we collect inputs from various stakeholders that inform the development and evolution of the C++ task-graph framework (codename: GSFD, which stands for Graph-Step-Field-Data), and very importantly, its Constitution. These inputs help ensure that the constitution reflects the needs and priorities of all parties involved, and to ensure the smooth execution of the project through AI agent-driven management best practices.

This project is conceived to be Agent-First, meaning that AI agents will play a central role in driving the development process. The constitution will therefore include specific provisions to facilitate effective collaboration between human developers and AI agents, ensuring that both can contribute meaningfully to the project's success.
