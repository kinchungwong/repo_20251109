# AGENTS.md - `repo_20251109/experiments/2025-11-opencv-mini/scripts`

This directory contains build scripts for OpenCV mini build used by the project.
These scripts are used by automated agents to set up the OpenCV environment, either directly or indirectly via CMake and CI/CD pipelines.
ALWAYS seek user approval, BEFORE editing these scripts, unless pre-approved.
If approval is not granted immediately, summarize the intended changes into short term memory or research notes as appropriate.
When editing, make sure all changes are consistent across all artifacts that produce the OpenCV mini build, including shell scripts and CMake scripts.
After editing, notify the user for review and approval.
