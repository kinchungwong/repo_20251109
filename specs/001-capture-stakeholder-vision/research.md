# Research Log: Stakeholder Vision and Stack Spikes

<!-- Summarize why this research file exists, who owns it, and how it supports the spec/plan without duplicating them. -->

## Stakeholder Interviews & Inputs

<!-- Capture interview synthesis, quotes, and priorities grouped by stakeholder persona; highlight conflicts or non-negotiables raised during discovery. -->

## Spike Hypotheses & Prioritization Heuristics

<!-- Record the decision matrix for each proposed spike (hypothesis, risk addressed, success signals, owner) plus the heuristics used to rank them. -->

## Evidence & Artifacts

<!-- List links or paths to supporting evidence (meeting notes, sanitized logs, tracker exports) along with short annotations explaining what each artifact proves. -->

## Decisions & Trade-offs

<!-- Document finalized decisions, trade-offs, and rationale (e.g., why a spike was deferred) so the spec can reference these without repeating the full reasoning. -->

## Open Questions & Follow-ups

<!-- Track unresolved questions, pending approvals, or follow-up work items that require stakeholder action; include due dates or owners when known. -->
