# Cross-Reference Prefix Registry
**Scope**: Track every identifier prefix (FR, SC, EC, etc.) used across repo_20251109 artifacts so references stay unique and discoverable.  
**Status**: Living registry maintained alongside the constitution and templates; update this file whenever a new prefix is introduced or retired.

## How to Use This Registry
- Before inventing a new prefix, add an entry here describing its scope, primary artifacts, and any special notes.
- When deprecating a prefix, keep the entry and annotate it with the replacement to preserve historical traceability.
- Any change to this file should trigger the constitution’s consistency validation step so dependent artifacts stay aligned.

## Registered Prefixes
*No prefixes are registered yet. Use the mock row below as a formatting example and replace it when the first real prefix is approved.*

| Prefix | Scope / Meaning | Primary Artifact(s) | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| EXAMPLE_FR-### | Example functional requirement prefix (placeholder) | `specs/###-feature/spec.md` | Replace this row with the first ratified prefix entry. |

<!-- Reserve additional rows for future prefixes as they are ratified. -->

<!--
Example entry style:
| FR-### | Functional Requirement identifiers | specs/###-feature/spec.md | Mandatory behavior grouped by lifecycle stage. |
-->
