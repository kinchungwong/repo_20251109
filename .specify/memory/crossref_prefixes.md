# Cross-Reference Prefix Registry
**Scope**: Track every identifier prefix (FR, SC, EC, etc.) used across repo_20251109 artifacts so references stay unique and discoverable.  
**Status**: Living registry maintained alongside the constitution and templates; update this file whenever a new prefix is introduced or retired.

## How to Use This Registry
- Before inventing a new prefix, add an entry here describing its scope, primary artifacts, and any special notes.
- When deprecating a prefix, keep the entry and annotate it with the replacement to preserve historical traceability.
- Any change to this file should trigger the constitution’s consistency validation step so dependent artifacts stay aligned.
